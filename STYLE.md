# Javascript style guide

- File names are all lowercase, with underscores between words.

- Tab characters are not used for indentation, only space characters (ASCII 0x20) are

- The first curly bracket after a function declaration or if-else statement/for loop is placed one space after the function declaration or statement. The last curly bracket is placed one line below the bottom of the inside of the function. Like this:

function(something) {
  do something
}

If the function is very short and anonymous, it can also be written on a single line like this:

function() { do something }

- a semicolon is placed after a specific block of code

- Indentation is done by using two space characters

- Between functions, two newline characters are inserted

- Comments are written with a space after the // characters, and they start with an uncapitalized character. They end without a period. Like so:

// this is a comment

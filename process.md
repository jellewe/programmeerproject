# day 1

Today I did a few things:

- I converted my two CSV files to one JSON, so that I can access the data more easily. This was recommended by my daily standup partners, and I think it will be very useful for my future work. This took up a lot of my time today.

- I started coloring my DataMaps map with the JSON file I had made. This did not take up so much time, but I had a problem with getting the d3 scaler right. I turned out I needed the 'quantize' scaler. Tomorrow I should look up more about making a log scale, or using the 'threshold' d3 scaler. This might improve the readability of the map a bit more.
